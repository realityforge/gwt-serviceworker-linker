# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Change the default value of the configuration property `serviceworker_optimize_serviceworker` from `false` to `true`. As a result serviceworkers will be optimized and obfuscated by default.
* If the `serviceworker_log_level` configuration property ise set to `0` then use an alternative service worker template that has logging statements explicitly stripped out. It seems that the optimizer used by the linker is not smart enough to apply the transform automatically.
